  <p>
    <strong>Qiskit Fall Fest — University of Ottawa</strong> is a student-run celebration of learning,
    making, and community in quantum computing. Over one weekend, we bring together curious beginners,
    builders, and mentors for hands-on workshops and a friendly hackathon powered by IBM Quantum tools
    and the uOttawa community.
  </p>

  <h3>What you’ll do</h3>
  <ul class="keypoints">
    <li><strong>Day 1 · Workshops:</strong> learn qubits, circuits, and Qiskit by building small programs and visualizing results.</li>
    <li><strong>Day 2 · Hackathon:</strong> team up to prototype something useful or delightful—QML demos, optimization ideas, or open-ended experiments.</li>
    <li><strong>Mentor hours:</strong> get guidance on scoping, debugging, and demo storytelling.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Who should attend</h3>
  <ul class="keypoints">
    <li><strong>New to quantum?</strong> Perfect—no prior experience required. If you can follow Python basics, you’re ready.</li>
    <li><strong>CS/Math/Physics/Engineering students</strong> looking to explore quantum concepts with practical code.</li>
    <li><strong>Designers, product thinkers, and data folks</strong> who want to help teams craft clear use-cases and demos.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>What you’ll learn</h3>
  <ul class="keypoints">
    <li>How qubits, gates, and measurement fit into quantum circuits.</li>
    <li>Running code with <em>Qiskit</em> in notebooks and IBM Quantum Lab; when to use simulators vs. real backends.</li>
    <li>Intro to Quantum Machine Learning and optimization problem framing.</li>
    <li>Collaboration skills: scoping an idea, version control, and presenting a demo.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Tools we’ll use</h3>
  <ul class="keypoints">
    <li>Qiskit (Python), Jupyter/Colab/IBM Quantum Lab.</li>
    <li>GitHub for projects and submissions.</li>
    <li>Discord for announcements, team-finding, and #helpdesk support.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Inclusion & accessibility</h3>
  <p>
    We strive to make Fall Fest welcoming for everyone. Venues are accessible; dietary options will be available
    during the hackathon. If you need accommodations, let us know in advance or message <strong>#helpdesk</strong> on Discord.
